# L2Divine Installer #

I made **L2Divine** Installer for users.

[Get latest version for Lindvior](http://code.google.com/p/l2divine-installer/downloads/detail?name=L2Divine10.5.3.2415_Setup.exe&can=2&q=)
> or
[latest version for Epeisodion/Valiance](http://code.google.com/p/l2divine-installer/downloads/detail?name=L2Divine10.6.8.2464_Setup.exe&can=2&q=)

Feature:
  * need nothing else without this to download (Guidebook including)
  * Dat language selectable for Japanese, Taiwanese, ~~Korean~~ (and Thailand) users
  * l2divine.ini is safety (not overwrite, not delete and not add new key without Lang, UI, WinTitle and EnableGameGuard...)
  * Uninstall all eazily (without l2divine.ini and any files u added)
  * u can run L2Divine from Start Menu or Desktop shortcut
  * 59.3 MB large :p (more than half of size is MAP!)
  * u can update eazily (only run installer)

Enjoy!
